![hello](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ornj/me/master/static/img/logo.png)

I'm an east coast transplant building Internet things for Jawbone in San
Francisco.

I work primarily in Javascript and Python. I arrived at this by way of PHP and
in another life time, Actionscript.

I like building systems that are simple for users and pleasant for developers.
I always try to leave things a little better than the way I found them.
