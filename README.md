# ![hello](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ornj/me/master/static/img/logo.png)

I'm an east coast transplant building Internet things for [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) in ~~San Francisco~~ Seattle.

I work primarily in Javascript and Python. I arrived at this by way of PHP and in another life time, Actionscript.

I like building systems that are simple for users and pleasant for developers. I always try to leave things a little better than the way I found them.
